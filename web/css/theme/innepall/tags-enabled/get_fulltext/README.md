# `<cms:get_fulltext>`

Tag is used to fetch fulltext content for a cloned page.

```xml
<cms:get_fulltext id=k_page_id />
```

Helps review text that will be used for the fulltext search. If you see undesired content, then tweak **searchable** setting for editable fields.

## Example


```xml
<cms:get_fulltext id='14' />
```

↓↓

```txt

A junk in the searchable content means some fields should be excluded from search or their default values optimized.

## Admin-panel field

Place a dynamic field in template to view the content —

![](fullltext-field.png)

```xml
<cms:config_form_view>

  <cms:field 'fulltext' no_wrapper='1'><br>
    <label class="field-label" for="fulltext">
      <span>FullText</span><span class="desc">(searchable content autogenerated upon page save)</span>
    </label><br>
    <cms:set rows = "<cms:if k_page_id eq '-1'>1<cms:else />5</cms:if>" />
    <textarea id="fulltext" name="fulltext" class="textarea" rows="<cms:show rows />" style="background-color: #e8e8e8; height: auto" readonly><cms:if k_page_id eq '-1'>* page not saved *</cms:if><cms:get_fulltext id=k_page_id /></textarea>
  </cms:field>

</cms:config_form_view>
```

Make sure you understand the MySQL fulltext [^1] indexing strategy — by default settings, words less than 4 and more than 84 characters will be ignored; as well as the stop words —
