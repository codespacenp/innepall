Open config.php (usually in folder with CMS e.g. /couch/config.php) and tweak this setting:

// 26.
// If the admin-panel uses a custom theme, set the following to the folder-name of the theme.
// Theme folder is expected to be within the 'couch/theme' folder. No leading or trailing slashes please.
define( 'K_ADMIN_THEME', 'ryazania-free' );

Unpack zip into /couch/theme/ folder. You should have snippets going like
/couch/theme/ryazania-free/content_form.html
etc..

Everything just works "out of the box". Explore README.md files (also in subfolders), there is everything there.
