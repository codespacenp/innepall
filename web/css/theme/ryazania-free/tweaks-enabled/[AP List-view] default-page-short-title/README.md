## Default page name tweak

The very first cloned page normally has a very long title &mdash;

> `Default page for index.php *PLEASE CHANGE THIS TITLE*`

This tweak keeps the title short, simply

> `Default page for index.php`

Additionally, **page is auto-unpublished** (with tweak **[AP List-view] default-page-unpublish**).

Lifehack: Existing 'default' pages can be deleted, then it reappears renamed and unpublished.

Tweak **[AP List-view] exclude-default-page** hides such pages automatically.
